/**
 * The goal of the diet problem is to find the cheapest combination of foods

 * The problem is formulated as a linear program where the objective is to minimize cost and 
 * meet constraints which require that nutritional needs be satisfied. 
 * We include constraints that regulate the number of 
 * calories and amounts of vitamins, minerals, fats, sodium and cholesterol in the diet.
