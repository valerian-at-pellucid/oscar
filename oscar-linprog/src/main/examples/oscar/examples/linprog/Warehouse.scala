/**
 * Capacitated Facility Location Problem
 *
 * There is
 * - a set of plants that can be open or not having a capacity
 * - a set of warehouses
 *
 *
 * Each warehouse has a demand that must be satisfied by one or more plant.
 * There is a cost specified
 * - for shipping one unit from a particular plant to a particular warehouse.
 * - for opening a plant
 *
 * The objective is to minimize the total cost while
 * satisfying the demand of the warehouses and the capacities of the plant
