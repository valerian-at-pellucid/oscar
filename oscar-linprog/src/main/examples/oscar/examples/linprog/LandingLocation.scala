/**
 * Uncapacitated facility location problem.
 *
 * A series of logs to cut and ship to a set of landings.
 * One must decide which logs to cut, which landings to open,
 * given shipment and landing opening costs
 * Cost of shipment of each log to each landing are known.
 * A minimal number of logs should be cut, modeled by a
 * trade-off coefficient and an additional term in the objective function.
