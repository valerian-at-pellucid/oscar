/**
 * Workforce management is central to efficient operations and good customer service.
 * Proper scheduling of employees can mean the difference between profitability and business failure.
 * As the manager of a popsicle stand, you are required to hire and set the weekly work schedule for your employees.
 * The required staffing levels for the week are as follows.
 * Total employees required: Monday=5, Tuesday=7, Wednesday=7, Thursday=10, Friday=16, Saturday=18, Sunday=12.
 * Assume the same staffing requirements continue week after week.
 * Full Time employees work 5 consecutive days and earn $100 per day.
 * Part Time employees work 2 consecutive days and earn $150 per day.
 * Question:  What is the minimal weekly staffing cost you can achieve while meeting the required staffing levels?
