<H2>Common due date scheduling</H2>

<PRE>There are 7 data files


The restricted single-machine common due date problem can
be stated as follows:

A set of n jobs with deterministic processing times p(i)
and a common due date d are given. The jobs have to be processed
on one machine. For each of the jobs an individual earliness
a(i) and tardiness b(i) penalty is given, which is incurred, if
a job is finished before or after the common due date d,
respectively. The goal is to find a schedule for the n
jobs which jointly minimizes the sum of earliness and tardiness
penalties.

The data files are:
  sch10, sch20, sch50, sch100, sch200, sch500, sch1000

The format of these data files is:
    number of problems
    for each problem in turn:
       number of jobs (n)
       for each job i (i=1,...,n) in turn:
          p(i), a(i), b(i)

The common due date d is calculated by:

d = round [SUM_P * h] 

where round[X] gives the biggest integer which is smaller then or equal to X;
Sum_P denotes the sum of the processing times of the n jobs and 
the parameter h is used to calculate more or less restrictive common due dates.

For the following 280 benchmarks we used h=0.2; h=0.4; h=0.6 and h=0.8.
