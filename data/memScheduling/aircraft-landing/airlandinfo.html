<PRE>There are currently 13 data files.

These data files are the test problems used in the papers
&quot;Scheduling aircraft landings - the static case&quot;
by J.E. Beasley, M. Krishnamoorthy, Y.M. Sharaiha and
D. Abramson, Transportation Science, vol.34, 2000, pp180-197; and
&quot;Displacement problem and dynamically scheduling aircraft landings&quot;
by J.E. Beasley, M. Krishnamoorthy, Y.M. Sharaiha and
D. Abramson, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 
vol.55, 2004, pp54-64.

The test problems are the files:
airland1, airland2, ..., airland13

The first eight files are those used in the Transportation Science paper referred to above.

The format of these data files is:
number of planes (p), freeze time
for each plane i (i=1,...,p):
   appearance time, earliest landing time, target landing time,
   latest landing time, penalty cost per unit of time for landing
   before target, penalty cost per unit of time for landing
   after target
   for each plane j (j=1,...p): separation time required after 
                                i lands before j can land

The value of the optimal solution for each of these data
files for a varying number of runways is given in the
above papers.

The largest file is airland13 of size 800Kb (approximately). 
The entire set of files is of size 1.3Mb (approximately).</PRE>
