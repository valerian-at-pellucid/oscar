<PRE>There are currently 10 data files.

These data files are the ten test problems from J.E.Beasley
and B.Cao &quot;A tree search algorithm for the crew scheduling 
problem&quot; European Journal of Operational Research 94 (1996) 
pp517-526.

The test problems solved in that paper are available in
the files csp50, csp100, csp150, csp200, csp250, csp300, 
csp350, csp400, csp450 and csp500 (where the number for
each csp file is the number of tasks).

The format of these data files is:
number of tasks (N), time limit
for each task i (i=1,...,N): start time, finish time
for each transition arc between two tasks (i and j):
i, j, cost of transition from i to j

The value of the optimal solution for each of these data files
for a varying number of crews is given in the above paper.

The largest file is csp500 of size 250Kb (approximately).
The entire set of files is of size 900Kb (approximately).</PRE>
