/**
 * The problem consist of plugging a set of electronic cards into racks with electric connectors.
 * Each card is characterized by the power it requires, while each rack model is characterized by
 * the maximal power it can supply, its number of connectors and its price.
 * Each card plugged into a rack uses a connector.
 * The goal is to find an allocation of a given set of cards into the available racks at the smallest cost.
