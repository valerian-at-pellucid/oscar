/**
 * Implementation of Path Constraint decomposition as described in 
 * "Solving the Longest Simple Path Problem with Constraint-Based Techniques" by Quang Dung, Yves Deville (CPAIOR2012)
 * 
 * - succ[i] is the successor of node i (also place i inside the domain of succ[i] if you want to allow it not to be part of the path
 * - start is the index of the first node on the path
 * - end is the index of the last node on the path
 * - length is the length of the path (number edges)
 * 
 * Example: 
 * succ [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 0], start = 0, end = 5, length = 3 represents the path 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
 * Notice that nodes that do not belong to the path, have them-self as successor and that 
 * the successor of the last node of the path is the first node by convention
