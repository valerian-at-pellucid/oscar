package oscar.cbls.invariants.core

/**
 * This package proposes a model of propagation.
 * A propagation is a wave that updates something in [[oscar.cbls.invariants.core.propagation.PropagationElement]]
 * Propagation elements have some dependencies that must be followed by the propagation wave.
 * Propagation elements are grouped in a structure called the [[oscar.cbls.invariants.core.propagation.PropagationStructure]]
 *
 * A propagation is like wave that sweeps the graph defined by the propagation elements,
 * calling the performPropagation method of each propagation element in such a way that
 - each propagate method is called only once
 - the propagate method of a propagation element is only called after all its preceding propagation elements have been propagated
 *
 * One might request targeted propagation, which specify that the propagation wave must only propagate
 * what is necessary to reach a defined element.
