  Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first
  five floors of this apartment house. Baker does not live on the
  fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher
  does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives
  on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a
  floor adjacent to Fletcher'. Fletcher does not live on a floor
  adjacent to Cooper's.
