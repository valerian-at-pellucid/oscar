  P-median problem in Oscar.

  Model and data from the OPL Manual, which describes the problem:
  """
  The P-Median problem is a well known problem in Operations Research.
  The problem can be stated very simply, like this: given a set of customers
  with known amounts of demand, a set of candidate locations for warehouses,
  and the distance between each pair of customer-warehouse, choose P
  warehouses to open that minimize the demand-weighted distance of serving
  all customers from those P warehouses.
