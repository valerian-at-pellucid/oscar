   A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier
   charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier
   calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items
   instead of adding them; I'll try again; Hah, with adding them the
   price still comes to $7.11''. What were the prices of the four items?
