/*

  Mr Smith problem in Oscar.

  From an IF Prolog example (http://www.ifcomputer.de/)
  """
  The Smith family and their three children want to pay a visit but they
  do not all have the time to do so. Following are few hints who will go
  and who will not:
   o If Mr Smith comes, his wife will come too.
   o At least one of their two sons Matt and John will come.
   o Either Mrs Smith or Tim will come, but not both.
   o Either Tim and John will come, or neither will come.
   o If Matt comes, then John and his father will
     also come.
  """
  
  The answer should be:
  Mr_Smith_comes      =  0
  Mrs_Smith_comes     =  0
  Matt_comes          =  0
  John_comes          =  1
  Tim_comes           =  1
