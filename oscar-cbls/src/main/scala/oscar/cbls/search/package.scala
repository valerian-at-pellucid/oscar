 * This package helps you writing your search procedures
 - selectors that are implemented into [[oscar.cbls.search.SearchEngine]] and [[oscar.cbls.search.SearchEngineTrait]]
 - standard neighborhoods and moves in [[oscar.cbls.search.move]]
 - combinators to assemble neighborhoods together and develop a search strategy.
 * these combinators are actually interfaced in all neighborhood so you can use an infix notation straight with any neighborhood
