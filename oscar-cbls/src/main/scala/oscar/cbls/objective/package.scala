package oscar.cbls

/** This package proposes the mechanics to model objective functions.
 * It basically offers some neighborhood evaluation methods that use the partial propagation
 * proposed by [[oscar.cbls.invariants.core.computation.Model]].
 * It features the [[oscar.cbls.objective.Objective]] class to model an objective in a problem statement, and
 * the [[oscar.cbls.objective.ObjectiveTrait]] to use in other classes.
